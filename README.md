# Question 1
Write for statements that print the following sequences of values:

a. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

b. 3, 8, 13, 18, 23

c. 20, 14, 8, 2, -4, -10

d. 19, 27, 35, 43, 51

# Question 2
One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts (sometimes called 'histograms'). Write a program that first reads and stores five numbers (each between 1 and 30). Then, for each number read, your program should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks (e.g. for the number seven, it should print *******), so that it displays five rows of asterisks.
